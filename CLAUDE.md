## How to work in this repo

- Tech stack & project structure: see [`README.md`](README.md).
- Commands: see `scripts` in [`package.json`](package.json).
    - `pnpm` is the project-standard package manager. Always respect [`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](pnpm-workspace.yaml) config.
    - Prefer using defined `pnpm` scripts over raw execution of binary commands (e.g., use `pnpm tsc` instead of `npx tsc --build`).
- Code style & conventions: see [`.claude/rules/code-style.md`](.claude/rules/code-style.md).
